% This directory contains a prototype implementation of
% Constraint Logic Programming over finite domains CLP(FD),
% on top of Prolog (currently Sicstus Prolog version 3 or 2).
% 
% This system has been realized only to serve *teaching purposes*,
% as a companion to the book of Francois FAGES,
% "Programmation Logique par Contraintes",
% Collection Cours de l'Ecole Polytechnique,
% Ellipse, Paris. 1996.
% 
% The source code is freely distributed without any warranty of any kind.
% Bug reports can be sent to fages@dmi.ens.fr, but there is no
% warranty that they will be fixed in new releases,
% nor that the system will be ported on top of other systems than
% Sicstus Prolog.
% 
% The system has been designed for a pedagogical purpose only.
% Much more efficient CLP(FD) systems are available on the market,
% and it is recommended to use these other systems for more
% advanced experimental works.
% 
% In order to install the system, just load the file make_clpFD.pl
% under Sicstus Prolog.
% 
% Not all the CLP(FD) predicates described in the appendix of the book
% have been implemented yet, a good exercise is to complete that library.
